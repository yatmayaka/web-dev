     <span style="font-family: fantasy ; font-size: 50px">T</span><span style="font-size: 20px">hree</span> men met at a tavern table.  One was a weaver, another a
carpenter and the third a ploughman. <br>
 
Said the weaver, “I sold a fine linen shroud today for two pieces
of gold.  Let us have all the wine we want<br>
 
“And I,” said the carpenter, “I sold my best coffin.  We will have
a great roast with the wine.”<br>
 
“I only dug a  <span style="font-variant: small-caps">grave</span>,” said the ploughman, “but my patron paid me
double.  Let us have honey cakes too.”<br>
 
     And all that evening the tavern was busy, for they called  <span style="font: italic normal bolder x-large serif">often</span>
for wine and meat and cakes.  And they were merry.<br>
 
And the host rubbed his hands and smiled at his wife; for his guests
were spending freely.<br>
 
When they left the moon was high, and they walked along the road
singing and shouting together.<br>
 
The host and his wife stood in the tavern door and looked after
them.<br>
 
     “Ah!” said the wife, “these gentlemen!  So frehanded and so <span style="text-decoration: line-through wavy">gay!</span> 
If only they could bring us such luck every day!  Then our son need
     not be a tavern-keeper and work so hard.  We could  <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: gold; font-weight: bold;">educate</span> him,
and he could become a priest.”<br>
